Performance optimized patient data storage In MongoDB
 
With the advent of patient centric solutions in the Health IT market such as patient-in-the center exchange models or stand alone patient health record software, there is a momentum to persist patient data in models similar to increasingly popular Blue Button CCDA.   These patient centric solutions typically use a NoSQL database such as the market leading MongoDB.   MongoDBâ€™s document based database solution is particularly well suited for such models.

In this paper we concentrate on a Blue Button CCDA based patient data model and investigate how to design patient data schemas to use MongoDB to its full potential.  Various schemas with varying document design and indexing choices are compared using various performance metrics and general recommendations are provided.  Such recommendations should prove useful not only for patient centric solutions but for VistA as well since similar models are being used or will be used for caching VistA data.

# Data Content

Here we investigate storage characteristics of patient health information which is referred as Master Health Record.  Master Health Record contains current and historical patient health information.  It is based on [blue-button](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button) data model which itself is based on Blue Button CCDA.

## Health Data Content

Following CCDA, Master Health Record is organized in sections such as allergies and medications and storage is built based on this sectional organization.  Sections are further organized as a set of entries. Thus the primary document that is stored here is an _entry_ whose content differs from section to section.  For example for allergies the [Mongoose schema](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for an entry is
``` javascript
var allergy_entry_schema = {
  allergen: {
    name: String,
    code: String,
    code_system_name: String,
    nullFlavor: String
    translations: [{
      name: String,
      code: String,
      code_system_name: String,
      nullFlavor: String
    }]
  },
  date: [{date: Date, precision: String}],
  identifiers: [{
     identifier:String,
     identifier_type: String
  }],
  severity: String,
  status: String,
  reaction: [{
    reaction: {  
      code: String, 
      name: String, 
      code_system_name: String,
      nullFlavor: String
      translations: [{
        name: String,
        code: String,
        code_system_name: String
        nullFlavor: String
      }],
     severity: String
    }
  }]
};
```

Each entry contains a small subset of fields ('summary fields') that patients can use to identify the entry in a list of entries.  Patients can select an entry from a list based on these fields to see more details.  For example `allergen_name`, `severity` and `status` is chosen as 'summary fields' for allergies
``` javascript
var allergy_summary_schema = {
  allergen_name: String,
  severity: String,
  status: String
};
```

Patient Master Heath Record is a collection of sections and each section is an array of entries
``` javascript
var mhr = {
  medications: [medication_entry],
  allergies: [allergy_entry],
  ...
};
```

Here we use here only a subset of possible over 70 CCDA sections: allergies, medications, procedures, vitals, problems, immunizations as implemented in [blue-button](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button) to simplify implementation.  Number of sections `num_sections` is a parameter for [benchmark scenarios](#scenarios) and for `num_sections` larger than 6 we simply repeat the sections with an indexed name (allergies_2, medications_2, etc.). 

## Metadata

For each entry we assume only two additional pieces of metadata: patient key and status.

Each entry belongs to a patient. We identify patient with a single string for which we use the variable `pat_key` in schema descriptions.  Patient key is important since our solution needs to be scalable with number of patients. 

We assume that each entry can have two states: `active` and `deleted`.  Active entries are those that are in a master health record. Deleted entries are once active ones that were removed from a master health record.  Once in the database entries are never physically removed.  We use variable `status` in schema descriptions to store states.

# Benchmark Scenarios

The benchmark scenarios are based on patient access to a simplified Personal Health Record application which stores Master Health Record for each patient using MongoDB.  This application has a 'dashboard' where patients can see their 'active' Master Health Record entries in a list.  The list is organized in sections and displays 'summary fields' for patients to identify a particular entry.  Patients can select a particular entry and can view it in its entriety, update or add new values to its fields, or remove it.  Patients can also add new entries either from sources like Blue Button Continuity of Care (CCD) documents automatically or manually. 

From database access point of view this translates to the following indivual actions

* Load the summary information for all the active entries organized in sections.
* Load all the details of an entry.
* Delete an entry.
* Update an entry.
* Add a new entry or entries as a whole.

We provide a method for each of these database actions using node.js MongoDB driver.  Implementation of benchmark scenarios is implemented in node.js and calls to these actions in a specific schedule.

<a name="initialSteps"/>
### Initial State and Common Parameters

Each scenario starts with a number of patient records loaded in the system.  The implementation of loading patients into the system accepts the following as parameters

* `num_patients`: Number of patients.
* `num_sections`: Average number of sections in master health record.
* `num_entries_per_section`: Average number of entries per section.
* `deleted_percentage`: The percentage of entries that are deleted with respect to total number of entries.

Actual content of the entries are fully synthetic data with string and arrays of predetermined length and predetermined number values.

Each scenario has steps corresponding to patient actions.  A value of `step_delay` in seconds is used between each step in the implementation.

### New Patient Scenario

In this scenario a patient adds all the entries in her Master Health Record in one step.   There does not exist any previous health data in the system for the patient.  The implementation of this scenario depends on the following parameters

* `new_patient_per_minute`: This is how many patients are created per minute.

Otherwise this scenario uses the same `num_sections` and `num_entries_per_section` in [initialization stage](#initialSteps).

### Review Master Health Record Scenario

In this scenario a patient launches the application to review her Master Health Record and possibly send it to her provider or print it.  She does not change any health information.  Implementation of this scenario loads all the active entry summary fields for a patient organized as sections.  Once the full list is loaded a subset of the list is loaded in its entirety.  The implementation depends on the following parameters

* `num_review_per_year`: This is the number of read only access to PHR per patient per year.  Depending on the number of patients in the system this determines the review only access per minute.
* `detailed_review_percent`: This determines the percentage of overall number of entries that the patient wants to see in its entirety.  This determines the number of entries that are fully loaded per review only session.

Loading of summary of all active entries and loading each entry fully are individual steps in this scenario and `step_delay` is used in between the steps.


### Update Master Health Record Scenario

In this scenario a patient launches the application to add new entries, remove an existing entry or update an existing entry. Implementation of this scenario loads all the active entry summary fields for a patient organized as sections.  Then new entries are added, a subset of entries are removed and a subset of entries are updated.  

The implementation depends on the following parameters
* `num_update_per_year`: This is the number of write access to master record per patient per year.  Depending on the number of patients in the system this determines write access to database per minute.
* `new_entries_percent`: This is the average number of new entries patient adds in percentage to the total number of entries for a patient.
* `remove_entries_percent`: This is the average number of entries patient removes in percentage to the total number of entries for a patient.
* `update_entries_percent`: This is the average number of entries patient updates in percentage to the total number of entries for a patient.

In addition the implementation considers loading the summary, adding new entries, removing existing entries and updating each existing entry as seperate steps and pauses `step_delay` second between them per patient.

# Database Designs

This work looks into various database designs to store Master Health Record [data content](#dataContent) in MongoDB from performance perspective.  This section describes all the designs that are compared.  Databases are described in terms of MongoDB collections and schema for each collection.

For simplicity in these design descriptions we use two sections: allergies and medications.  In the actual implementation of [scenarios](#scenarios) `num_sections` sections is used.

<a name="singleEntryDesigns"/>
## Single Entry Designs

<a name="design1"/>
## Design 1

In this design entries for a particular section are stored in its own collections.  The schema for collections _allergies_ and _medications_ are

``` javascript
var allergies_schema = {
  data: allergy_entry_schema,
  pat_key: String,
  status: String
};

var medications_schema = {
  data: medication_entry_schema,
  pat_key: String,
  status: String
};
```
`pat_key` is always indexed.  Indexing of `status` and 'summary fields' are additional design choices that are investigated.

## Design 2

This is a variation of [Design 1](#design1) where all sections are stored in the same collection.  To identify an individual section type an indexed `section_name` property is added to the schema.  Thus _allergies_ and _medications_ are replaced by a single _entries_ collection whose schema is
``` javascript
var entries = {
  data: allergies_entry_schema,  // varies with section type medication_enry_schema, etc.
  pat_key: String,
  status: String,
  section_name: String,
};
```
As in [Design 1](#design1) `pat_key` is always indexed and indexing of `status` and 'summary fields' are additional design choices that are investigated.

## Design 3

In this design instead of identifying patient with an indexed `pat_key` as part of each entry record there is a patient collection which includes all the entries
``` javascript
var patients = {
  pat_key: String,
  allergies: [ObjectId],
  medications: [ObjectId]
  deleted_allergies: [ObjectId],
  deleted_medications: [ObjectId],
  ...
};
```
The _entries_ collection now simply stores health data (schemas `allergies_entry_schema`, `medication_entry_schema`, etc.).  Indexing of 'summary fields' remain as additional design choice that is investigated.

## Design 4

This is a variation of Design 3 except that `status` and `section_name` are stored as part of the entries array in patients collection instead of seperate properties.
``` javascript
var patients = {
  pat_key: String,
  entries: [{
     id: ObjectId,
     status: String,
     section_name: String
  ]
};
```
Both `status` and `section_name` are indexed.  

## Designs 1d, 2d, 3d and 4d

These are variations of Designs 1, 2, 3, and 4 where 'summary fields' are stored in seperate collections instead of being indexed.  For example additional collections for Design 1 are
``` javascript
var allergies_summary_schema = {
  data: allergy_summary_schema,
  pat_key: String,
  status: String
};

var medications_summary, schema = {
  data: medication_summary_schema,
  pat_key: String,
  status: String
};
```
Although status is not really required to be stored in summary collections based on our Scenarios and simplified model we include it because in an actual PHR application more than one status is likely and multiple summary lists per seperate states might exist.

## Multiple Entry Designs

In each of the designs in the previous [section](#singleEntryDesigns), the basic document is an entry in a particular section.  The designs in this section explores the possibility to store multiple entries in a single document.  Since there is a 16M limit on a single document there must be a limit on the number entries a single document can contain. This limit `entries_per_document` is a parameters of that we vary to investigate performance.   

# Implementation and Performance Metric

All the benchmark [scenarios](#scenarios) are implemented node.js and access to MongoDB using MongoDB node.js driver.  We run MongoDB on a Linux (Ubuntu) Virtual Machine on a Mac Pro laptop.  The [initialization steps](#initSteps) (loading preexisting patient data) is not part of the actual benchmark scnerio but is considered part of environment setup.  The scenarios are run on the Mac Pro itself and access the MongoDB virtual machine through the MongoDB port. 

In this effort we mainly depend on MongoDB 'Profiler' for performance metric.  The profiler comes with MongoDB and stores all the executed commands and the execution duration in the database.  Our approach is to run our scenarios with profiler turned on for all the design choices and compare the execution times.  In addition to choice of the database design, variations in parameters described in [scenarios](#scenarios) are also investigated.
